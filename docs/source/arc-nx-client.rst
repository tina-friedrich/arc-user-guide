Configuring NoMachine client access
-----------------------------------

Step 1: After starting the client, click ``Add`` on the first screen to add a new connection. On the next screen give the connection a name, in the example below we have used ``ARC`` you **must** specify the host as ``nx.arc.ox.ac.uk`` and click ``Connect``

After clicking ``OK`` the connection will be made and you will be presented with the Linux KDE desktop in a window on your machine. The menu bar for accessing applications is at the bottom of this window.
